# Dating-App-Ui

This project is a React Native application for a dating app interface, inspired by a tutorial I followed on YouTube. The original tutorial was in JavaScript, but I have adapted it to TypeScript to suit the development standards at Quantum Pinnacle Matrix, where I'm applying my learning in React Native and leveraging the Expo framework for streamlined development.

## Tutorial Reference

The UI design and initial codebase were inspired by a React Native tutorial available on YouTube. You can view the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9XbqVbzET8).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript (Originally JavaScript in the tutorial)
- **UI Library**: React Native

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- Expo CLI

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
```
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/HasanTayar/Dating-App-Ui.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash 
cd Dating-App-Ui
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash 
npm install
```
4. or if you use Yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
## Running the App
To start the Expo development server and run the app:
```bash
npx expo start
```
This command will open a webpage where you can choose to run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or your physical device using the Expo Go app.
